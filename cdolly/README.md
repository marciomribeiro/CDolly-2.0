## Instructions ##

### Importing Project to Eclipse ###
Assuming you cloned the project into the folder ```cdolly```, consider the following steps:

1. Create a new Java project
2. In ```Project name```, use ```cdolly``` 
3. Add the folder ```src``` as a source folder
4. Add all jars from ```libs``` to the classpath

Now you should have CDolly properly imported as an Eclipse project.

### Running CDolly ###
By the moment, CDolly does not have a build script. If you are not using Eclipse (or another IDE), you will have to compile manually everything. It is easier to just run one of the examples in the ```cdolly.example``` package through an IDE.
